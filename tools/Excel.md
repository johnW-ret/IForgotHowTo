# Conditional Formatting
When applying conditional formatting to a range, it's easy as a programmer to be confused about what is the "generic element" passed the formula as your "predicate", but remember that Excel formulas can be anchored but default to not being anchored. If you want to apply the formula to every cell in the range, choose the top-left cell as your cell in the formula.

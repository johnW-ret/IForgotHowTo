Shortcuts
=========

The intent of this document is not to grow a complete list of shortcuts across all applications I care about, as many shortcuts can be found quickly online. Instead, this document is meant to be a list of shortcuts that I have found useful, but are not as easy to lookup. This is not a hard and fast rule. You can also see the markdown table below has a source column, since sometimes shortcuts change.
